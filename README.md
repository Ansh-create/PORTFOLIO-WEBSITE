 <p align="justify">Created using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and BOOTSTRAP, hosted on VERCEL App. 
  
 With the help of this portfolio website it helps me to display my web presence, skills, interests, family background, resume, projects, certificates, achievements, photoshoot skills etc. In this project I tried to use SMTP to send emails by enabling SMTP servers in my GMAIL account.</p>
